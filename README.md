# Introduction to Jasmine, BDD for JavaScript
## Given at the East Bay Ruby Meetup, 2010.10.19

This repo is a presentation, in a single HTML file, that I gave at the EBRM.

To view, open [`jasmine-intro.html`](/jasmine-intro.html) in a reasonable HTML browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox).

This presentation was made with Keydown, a Ruby gem I'll be hollering about shortly.
